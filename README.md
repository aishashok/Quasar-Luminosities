# Gaussian Process Regression

This repository is considered as a partial fulfillment for a graduate level course in Astronomy :  Intro to Astro Research (ASTR 6410)

In this project, I estimate the brightness (read as magnitudes) of quasars that lie between the epochs in the universe using Gassuian Process Regession models. I model the available quasars from the E-BOSS part of the large SDSS Survey.


*Quasars are very bright sources (very luminous active galactic nuclei) that are present in the centers of galaxies. They are powered by super massive black holes.
