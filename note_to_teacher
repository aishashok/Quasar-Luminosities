Note to the teacher:
I have uploaded my code in a .py format and have also uploaded my target file which contains the basic informtion to use to get the spectra to obtain the magnitudes.
The spectra data is recieved from chpc and the path is:'/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss02/ebosswork/eboss/spectro/redux/v5_10_0/spectra/lite
